This is the repository for Cesar and Hardhik's implementation of the ECE128 Lab 9 design. This lab consisted of 2 different module implementations: a sequential multiplier and a combinational multiplier. For the design source, add the file that does not contain the "_tb" designation. For the simulation source, add the file that contains the "_tb" designation. Ensure the appropriate files are enabled and disabled for running synthesis, implementation, bitstream generation, and waveform generation. Analyzing the waveform of the testbenches will provide the most insight into the validity of the module designs. For using the Basys3 with our designs, the group of 4 switches furthest right on the board represent operand one, and the group of 4 switches immediately left of the previous group represent operand two. These groups are in 4-bit binary, thus each operand is only able to represent digits 0-15. The result is outputted by the LEDs above the switches, where the furthest right LED represents 0 or 1, the LED to its immediate left represents bit 0 or 2, the LED to its immediate left represents bit 0 or 4, and so on. The maximum output on the board for both implementations is 225.
